<p>
When programming, everything can be broken down to a fairly simply rule:

<p class="code">
if <b><i>this</i></b> then <b><i>that</i></b>
</p>

<p>
So, all a program does is check if <i>this</i> happens, and if it does then <i>that</i> happens - like, "if a key is pressed then the player will move". Put into a more <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> friendly format it would be expressed as 

<p class="code">
if <b><i>event</i></b> then <b><i>act</i></b>
</p>

<p>
Which means that if an <b>event</b> is triggered, then a specific action must be performed. An event is simply a moment in time when something happens, and some events can be triggered once (like the <i>Global Mouse Left Down</i> event) or can be triggered every game frame (like the <i>Step Event</i>). Let's look at how to use these events to make our ship perform an action, in this case, move.

<p>
You'll need to open the object "<tt>obj_ship</tt>" (if it's not already open) by double clicking <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../Icon_LMB.png"> it in the resource tree. When open, you can then click <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../Icon_LMB.png"> on the <b>Add Event</b> to bring up the <b>Event List</b>:

<p>
<img class="center" src="../Images/C2_05_01_EventList.png" alt="The Object Event List">

<p>
There are two ways that we can check if the player is moving:

<p>
<ul>
	<li>Use the discreet <b>Keyboard Events</b>, which will only be triggered when a key press is detected, or
	<li>Use the <b>Step Event</b> and check using code for a keypress every step (game frame)
</ul>

<p>
What you use in your projects is largely a matter of choice and will depend on how you like to work and the structure of your project. In this case, we are going to use the <b>keyboard Down Events</b>, which are events that will be triggered as long as the specified key is held down. Any action code we add in here, will be run once for every game frame that the key is held down for, so if we held the key down for a second, it would have run the actions the event contains 60 times, since our game speed is set to 60FPS.

<p>
Go ahead and add a <b>Keyboard Down Event</b> for the <i>left</i> arrow down and then another one for the <i>right</i> arrow down (both are highlighted in the image below to illustrate the ones you need, but you need to add them one at a time):

<p>
<img class="center" src="../Images/C2_05_02_KeyboardEvents.png" alt="The Keyboard Events">

<p>
These events are our "if" - asking "if a key is held down" - but we haven't told <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> what to do if that is actually <tt>true</tt>. For that we'll need to add some <b>DnD&trade;</b>. You'll see that when you added the events, each one added a tab within the <b>DnD&trade; Editor</b> for you to add your actions into:

<p>
<img class="center" src="../Images/C2_05_05_ActionEditor.png" alt="The Action Editor">

<p>
Here you drag actions from the different <b>Toolbox</b> groups on the right and "chain" them together to create the game logic. So, the basic interpretation of what we want to do first would be "if the left key is pressed, rotate the ship to the left", and we have the "if" part done using the Keyboard Down Event, which means we have to do the "rotate the ship" part now.

<p>
Click on the "<b>Key Down - Left</b>" left tab in the DnD&trade; Editor to select that event, then go to the <b>Instances</b> section of the Toolbox and drag <a href="gms2tutorials:///ShowHelp?tag=action_sprite_rotate"><tt>Set Instance Rotation</tt></a> into the editor:

<p>
<img class="center" src="../Images/DND_C2_05_01_SetRotation.gif" alt="Set The Instance Rotation">

<p>
With this action we are adding 5 to the <a href="gms2tutorials:///ShowHelp?tag=image_angle"><tt>image_angle</tt></a> of the instance every step (game frame) that the key is held down. The <tt>image_angle</tt> variable governs the angle at which the assigned sprite will be drawn, and the action <tt>Set Instance Rotation</tt> sets this value. Note that we have also checked the <b>relative</b> flag on the action. If we don't check that then the action will set the <tt>image_angle</tt> to an <i>absolute</i> values, i.e. it will always equal 5. But by checking <i>relative</i>, we are saying to <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> that the value should be added to the current value, i.e. <tt>image_angle = image_angle + 5</tt>.

<div class = "note">
	<b>NOTE</b>: <tt>image_angle</tt> is an <b>instance variable</b> which is a variable that all instances of objects will have. There are many different instance variables, and all of them will be useful to you at some point while creating your games, so take a moment to find out more reading <a href="gms2tutorials:///ShowHelp?tag=instance_variables">the manual</a>.
</div>

<p>
Why are we adding 5 if we are turning left? That's because angles in <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> go <b>anti-clockwise</b> with 0&deg; being to the right:

<p>
<img class="center" src="../Images/C2_05_03_Angles.png" alt="How Angles Are Calculated">

<p>
This is why we made our ship sprite facing right - it makes setting the angles when rotating much easier! 

<p>
We can use almost the exact same action for turning the ship to the right, so right click <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../Icon_RMB.png"> on the action, then select <i>Copy</i>, then click on the tab for "<b>Key Down - Right</b> to select it. Right click <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../Icon_RMB.png"> again in the DnD&trade; editor workspace and select <i>Paste</i>. You need to edit the amount to change the angle by to -5, since we want it to rotate to the right:

<p>
<img class="center" src="../Images/DND_C2_05_02_RotateRight.png" alt="Rotate The Image Right">

<p>
You can press the <b>Play</b> button <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../Icon_Play.png"> now, and if you press the left/right arrow keys you should see your ship instance rotating.

<p>

<p>
We are now ready to make the player ship move! Click "Next" to continue...
